# IP adress of our pi = 10.140.175.183

###Week 1 Checklist
- [x] Thomas: Write up Plan in proper table
- [x] Thomas: Check all have signed aggreement 
- [x] Thomas: photo of maze uploaded
- [x] Thomas: Research error correction and code for following line
- [x] Julian: Produce code for straight line
- [x] Julian: Research PID and SSH
- [x] Adam: Help out Julian 
- [x] Adam: Research networking communication signal to open gate
- [x] Harry+Thomas: Setup team github repository
- [x] Nicky+Harry: Develop prototype chassis with pi
- [x] Nicky+Harry: Try assemble first prototype
- [x] Everyone: Add each other on facebook and set up group chat

##Week 1 review
Everyone did their assigned tasks, we got a group chat going and everyone successfully showed up to our lab.
This week hopefully we can get our robot following the line and get the basic robot chassis sorted. 

##Week 2 Checklist
- [x] Thomas: Review and record progress
- [x] Nicky+Harry: Work on making upgraded chassis prototype 2 which can turn easily (180mm space) and hold sensors
- [x] Julian: Work on code for making robot follow the white line
- [x] Adam: Work on code which will open the network gate
- [x] Thomas: Help work on code or if not needed help with prototype 2
 
##Week 2 review
Week 2 we managed to get the robot to follow the line, but it used the "reverse backwards" method instead of PID so hopefully we can change it in future to use PID. On the hardware side we managed to make some plans for our final robot design, these need to be uploaded to github, and used to write our reports. Networking code managed to be completed but hasnt been tested yet.

##Week 3 Checklist
- [ ] Thomas: Review and record progress
- [ ] Nicky+Harry: Work on chassis design and try to start building it.
- [ ] Julian: Work on code for making robot follow the white line through intersections and turns
- [ ] Adam: Finalise and test networking code, ensure it works as expected, try and merge it with line following code
- [ ] Thomas: Help work on code or if not needed help with prototype
- Overall robot should: move forward, stop at gate, send network signal, wait till gate is opened, start doing line following code

##Week 4 Checklist
- [ ] Thomas: Review and record progress
- [ ] Nicky+Harry: Start building/printing the final robot design and putting things together especially sensors
- [ ] Julian: Finish code to make robot follow white line doesnt have to be perfect PID, tune it for current robot.
- [ ] Adam: Write code so that robot responds to walls of maze ie when a wall is sensed in front of the robot make it stop and turn
- [ ] Thomas: Help work on code or if not needed help with prototype

##General Plan
 - Week1: Assign Roles, assemble basic robot, get it moving
 - Week2: Robot moves through gate and in straght lines and turns, (Quadrant 1)
 - Week3: Robot should be able to follow tape (Quadrant 2)
 - Week4: Robot should be able to follow tape through intersections and turns (Quadrant 3)
 - Week5 onwards: Work on Challenge part (Quadrant 4)
